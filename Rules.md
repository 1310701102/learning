# SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT


1. Singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs.

FOUR EASY STEPS FOR AVOIDING SUBJECT-VERB EMBARRASSMENT
--------
1. Find the main verb. Don't be distracted by verbals, which are verb like elements acting as another part of speech.

2. Ask yourself, Who or what is doing this action? The subject does not necessarily come before the verb, and there may be all kinds of distracting modifiers and the verb.

3. Is the subject singular or plural? Most of the time, a plural subject will end in -s; there are plenty of exceptions. You my also have to consider the intended meaning of the word.

4. If your subject is singular, match if with the correct verb, If your subject is plural, match they with the correct verb. Use your ear!
    
    
MORE RULES
--------

1. Subjects connected by `and` are plural: Michael an Uzair are friends.

2. Certain expressions (`as well as`, `including`, `together with`, `with`, etc) logically seem to change a singular subject to plural. They don't. These expressions will be set off from the subject by commas.

	1. Bob, along with Uzair and Chris, is going on vacation.

	2. Uzair, as well as Bob, plans to stay at home instead of going on vacation.

3. Singular subjects connected by conjunctions cuch as `either-or`, `neither-nor`, and `nor` stay singular.

	1. Neither Mary nor Harry is able to get up from their bed.

4. If a singular and plural subject are connected by `either-or`, `neither-nor`, `or`, or `nor` the verb should agree the subject closer to it.

	1.Neither Bob nor the others were able to get up from their seats.

	2.Neither the others nor Bob was able to get up from their seats.
